## Visualization 1: Explore Animal Populations Over Time

This visualization was developed in D3 and displays animal populations on a world map. There is a slider where you can explore the distributions of animal populations over the years from 1950 to 2020. There is also an option to filter by animal class so you can better investigate the distributions of specific animal groups (especially since the fish populations dominate the overall visualization).

## Visualization 2: Explore Wildlife Populations by Common Name Over Time

This visualization was developed in Tableau and depicts wildlife populations on the world map during the years 1960 and 2014. The populations are grouped by Common Name, which are set apart using color. Moreover, the number of animals observed in each recording is quantified using scale, or a proportionately sized encoding. The parallel nature of these two maps allows the viewer to easily compare populations across the two endpoints of the data. 

## Visualization 3: Explore How Wildlife Populations are Changing Over Time

This visualization was also developed in Tableau and portrays how wildlife populations are changing over time, using multiple horizontal bar charts. There are distinct bar charts for each Taxonomic group, and each bar chart is divided into increasing, stable, and decreasing populations. Each division in the bar chart (increasing, stable, or decreasing) is delineated by a unique color.

## Visualization 4: Explore Living Planet Index Over Time and By Region

This visualization was developed in Tableau. It depicts the Living Population Index (LPI), a percentage, through line graphs for the world and for different regions. For the World LPI graph, the middle line is the LPI, while the lines below and above show the lower and upper confidence intervals, respectively. For the LPI by Region graph, there are separate lines for comparison of the world and different regions: freshwater, Africa, Asian and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and North America.

## Visualization 5: Explore Number of Species Organized by Class in the Living Planet Database

This visualization was developed using Altair. The pie chart separates all the different species in the Living Planet Database (LPD) by the five different animal classes: amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, and reptiles.

## Visualization 6: Explore Increase in Numbers of Animal Populations Over Time

This visualization was developed in Altair and depicts the 20 animals in the world with the greatest increase in population. This is portrayed using horizontal bar charts, where each bar chart represents a Common Name of animals in the data. The bar charts are ordered from descending percent of average relative change in size of populations, and an Altair color scheme is used to depict the magnitude in change. Moreover, a logarithmic scale and tooltip are implemented to make viewing easier for the reader.

## Visualization 7: Explore Decrease in Numbers of Animal Populations Over Time

This visualization was developed in Altair and depicts the 20 animals in the world with the greatest decrease in population. This is portrayed using horizontal bar charts, where each bar chart represents an Order of animals in the data. The bar charts are ordered from ascending percent of average relative change in size of populations, and an Altair color scheme is used to depict the magnitude in change. Moreover, a tooltip is implemented to make viewing easier for the reader.

## Visualization 8: Numbers of Animal Populations and Species Over Time

This visualization was developed in Altair and shows how populations and species change over time. Both increased from 1950 to 2011 but have steadily decreased since then. The visualization also includes a tooltip that allows you to pinpoint more specific data points while allowing you to look at the changes as a whole.
