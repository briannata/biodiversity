  <h1>Biodiversity Visualizations Dashboard</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>In our project, we would like to gain an understanding on the state of Earth’s biodiversity. Biological diversity includes all living beings, not just the species categorized as endangered, and each living being plays a variety of important roles. Healthy ecosystems are dependent on biodiversity, which means we as humans are dependent as well. Ecosystems are where we get certain resources, like land, water, food, and shelter—all essential for our livelihood. This is in addition to the intrinsic and cultural values we have ascribed to nature.</p>

  <p>However, human actions have been threatening biodiversity, leading to the unprecedented decline and extinction of animal populations and species. Therefore, it becomes important that we take on the responsibility to protect and increase Earth's biodiversity. An important step in this process is visualizing and analyzing data on animal populations to understand trends and patterns. Digging deeper, by identifying specific species and populations experiencing the most severe declines, we can focus conservation efforts where they are most needed. Moreover, it is just as important to pinpoint species and populations successfully recovering, so we can gather information on what is working and better inform future conservation efforts. Ongoing success stories also serve to show that there is impact and hope in the work we do.</p>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>

  <p>Our biodiversity visualization dashboard offers comprehensive insight into the status and changes of animal populations across the globe. By integrating various visualization techniques, the dashboard provides a multifaceted exploration of biodiversity trends from 1950 to 2020. Through interactive maps, charts, and filters, users can delve into the dynamics of wildlife populations, identify trends, and discern patterns crucial for informed decision-making and environmental policy formulation.</p>

  <p>We utilized extensive datasets, Living Planet Index (LPI) and Living Planet Database (LPD), provided by the Living Planet Project to analyze animal populations and biodiversity trends comprehensively. The data comes from a compilation of scientific articles, online databases, and government reports. The most recent 2022 report includes 31,821 wildlife populations and around 5,230 species---all vertebrate species. It is important to note that the datasets contain only a small portion of the world's animal populations, and do not represent the entire globe equally, as some regions have more data.</p>

  <p>By incorporating LPI and LPD data into our visualizations, we gained invaluable insights into the health and trajectories of various animal populations over time. Leveraging this dataset, we were able to identify thriving animals that do not require immediate intervention, as well as those facing significant declines and needing urgent protection measures. Through careful analysis of LPD data, we pinpointed several animal species demonstrating positive population trends, indicating successful conservation efforts or favorable ecological conditions. Conversely, we identified animal classes experiencing declines, signaling areas of concern and the necessity for proactive conservation strategies. This utilization of the data from LPI and LPD enhances our understanding of global biodiversity patterns and allows policymakers and conservationists to prioritize resources and enact targeted measures to protect vulnerable species and ecosystems.</p>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This visualization was developed using Altair. The pie chart shows the number of species in each animal class in the Living Planet Database (LPD). We can see the distribution of species among each animal class and understand the LPD's representation of animal classes. With this information, we can prioritize the animal classes accordingly. This visualization will help us evaluate the biodiversity within ecosystems, as well as where there is missing data.</p>

  <h4>Justification</h4>
  <p>Understanding each animal class and how each species contributes to its environment is paramount in creating effective conservation policies. This visual representation offers a clear overview of the distribution of species across different classes like mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish in the database. Conservation efforts can be targeted effectively by knowing which animal classes are most diverse or most threatened. To get to this knowledge, it is important to analyze the source of the data and identify where there is a lack of data for certain species and animal classes.</p>

  <h4>Findings</h4>
  <p>The majority of species in the database are fish, then birds, mammals, amphibians, and, lastly, reptiles. Of the identified species so far, the classes&mdash;ordered by the most to least species&mdash;are fishes, reptiles, birds, amphibians, and mammals. From this, it seems that amphibians and reptiles are underrepresented in the LPD. We can also highlight that none of the animal species nor classes include invertebrates, which are also important for biodiversity and ecosystems. Overall, there are millions of species unaccounted for in the database of only a few thousand species, so the conclusions drawn through our visualizations and analysis only go so far in understanding the state of biodiversity today.</p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This visualization was developed in Altair, and it shows how the number of animal populations and species represented in the Living Planet Database (LPD) has changed over time. Both increased from 1950 to 2011, but have steadily decreased since then. The visualization also includes a tooltip that allows you to pinpoint more specific data points while allowing you to look at the changes as a whole.</p>
  
    <h4>Justification</h4>
    <p>It is important to understand the representation of populations and species in the database, which is why we looked into their records over time. We decided on a line graph to understand the trends over the years for the data, as well as see if there were any trends between number of populations and species being represented.</p>
  
    <h4>Findings</h4>
    <p>The number of populations and species which have a data point in a given year rises steadily from 1970, reaching a peak of greater than 18,000 and 3,100---respectively---in the late 1990s and early 2000s. After this point, numbers drop rapidly. As research on wildlife population change is still ongoing in more recent years, this reduction in the number of contributing populations and species is mainly due to a lag in the publication of collected data. In addition, data is published at a rate that creates a backlog of time-series data to be entered into the database, and newer data sources are unlikely to be added unless they are in line with the current focus of data collection. This is important to represent and understand about the LPD, as it means the conclusions we draw through our visualizations show an incomplete story. While the number of represented animal populations and species has increased, there are still many missing, especially updated data in the years after 2011.</p>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This visualization was developed in D3 and displays animal populations on a world map. It has a slider where you can explore the distributions of animal populations over the years from 1950 to 2020. You can also filter by animal class so you can better investigate the distributions of specific animal groups (especially since the fish populations dominate the overall visualization).</p>

  <h4>Justification</h4>
  <p>This world map graph displaying animal distributions and locations over time is invaluable for tracking animal populations and understanding biodiversity trends. By visualizing the spatial distribution of various animal species, we gain insights into their habitats, migration patterns, and population densities. The slider feature allows us to observe changes over time, revealing population size and distribution shifts. The size of each circle represents the number of animals in a particular area, providing a clear depiction of population density. This tool aids conservation efforts by highlighting regions with declining populations or habitats under threat, allowing for targeted conservation strategies. Furthermore, by filtering by animal class, researchers can focus on specific groups, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians, to analyze trends within each class. Understanding how animal populations change over time helps us assess the health of ecosystems, identify areas in need of protection, and monitor the effectiveness of conservation measures. Ultimately, this map contributes to the preservation of biodiversity by providing crucial data for informed decision-making and conservation planning.</p>

  <h4>Findings</h4>
  <p>In 1950, at the beginning, we can see that there are large animal populations of the Actinopteri (i.e., fish) class in North and Central America, and the populations continue to grow larger and in other regions through the years. Looking at more recent years, the populations of Actinopteri class mostly moved to the west coast and elsewhere. However, it seems like this could be more the result of the database lacking updated data from 2010 and onward, from the previous visualization. It is interesting slowly moving through the years to see certain animal populations grow, decline, and disappear altogether. This can point researchers and conservationists to areas of interest. Additionally, we can see that a lot of the animal population clusters are around North and Central America, as well as Europe. This is indicative of the data from LPD not being representative of other regions, like South America, Africa, and Asia, which are regions where there is a lot more biodiversity.</p>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This visualization was developed in Tableau and depicts wildlife populations on the world map between 1960 and 2014. The populations are grouped by Common Name, which is set apart using color. Moreover, the number of animals observed in each recording is quantified using scale or a proportionately sized encoding. The parallel nature of these two maps allows the viewer to compare populations across the two endpoints of the data easily.</p>

  <h4>Justification</h4>
  <p>These parallel world maps are helpful in further visualizing the spread and patterns of animal populations over the years. By selecting data from two endpoints of the Living Planet Database data, we enable the viewer to closely examine the trends in animal migration and habitation over time. Thanks to the interactive, scroll-and-zoom options that Tableau provides, researchers will be able to navigate to certain countries and regions that they are most interested in exploring. Moreover, the use of color and size on the map to distinguish between population size and common name will allow the viewer to seamlessly analyze animal migration and habitation patterns, as well as changes in population, over the years. This could enable researchers to identify the animals that require more conservation efforts, so they can divert more resources to support them. Moreover, researchers can identify which countries and regions have the greatest and least diversity of a certain animal, using our map, which can allow them to make better-informed policy decisions.</p>

  <h4>Findings</h4>
  <p>Right away, we can see that there are many more animal population clusters in 2014 than in 1960, which means that the data has become more representative of other regions, especially South America and Australia. However, the increase should not be interpreted as there being an increase in number of animals and animal populations, as there has been an average decline of 69% of animal populations. It is hard to pinpoint specific findings with this visualization, as each researcher or conservationist may find interest in different regions and animal populations.</p>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This visualization was also developed in Tableau and portrays how wildlife populations are changing over time, using multiple horizontal bar charts. There are distinct bar charts for each Taxonomic group, and each bar chart is divided into increasing, stable, and decreasing populations. Each division in the bar chart (increasing, stable, or decreasing) is delineated by a unique color.</p>

  <h4>Justification</h4>
  <p>In order to understand which animal groups hold the highest risk of endangerment, it is important to visualize trends in populations as a whole. This visualization achieves this by representing our data in a parallel manner, allowing the viewer to easily differentiate between the growth and decline of the different groups of animals. Researchers can use this visualization as a stepping stone to decide which group of animals requires the most intervention and support. For example, those with a higher proportion of decreasing populations should require more focus than those who are mostly increasing or stable.</p>

  <h4>Findings</h4>
  <p>From the bar chart, around half of the animal populations in each class are decreasing, while the other half is increasing. Otherwise, there is a small percentage of the populations staying stable. The class of animals, compared to the rest of the classes, that shows the most decreasing than increasing is amphibians. Next are fishes, birds, mammals, and reptiles. In addition to the need for more data collection, there needs to be more focus in conservation efforts for amphibians.</p>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This visualization was developed in Tableau. It depicts the Living Planet Index (LPI), a percentage, through line graphs for the world and for different regions on different tabs. For the World LPI graph, the middle line is the LPI from 1970 to 2018, while the lines below and above show the lower and upper confidence intervals, respectively. For the LPI by Region graph, there are separate lines for comparison of the world and different regions over time: freshwater, Africa, Asian and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and North America.</p>

  <h4>Justification</h4>
  <p>The Living Planet Index (LPI) is a measure on the state of the world's biological diversity based on population trends of vertebrate species from terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. This measure helps us understand the world's biodiversity as a whole. However, the world LPI can be too general, as it does not tell us any specifics on animal populations or species, which is why the other tab gives the LPI for different regions.</p>

  <h4>Findings</h4>
  <p>Once the LPI is given for different regions, we can pinpoint specific regions to focus conservation efforts on, such as Latin American and the Caribbean region and the freshwater region. There, the average decline is much worse than even the world LPI, so research and conservation should be focused on animal populations there. For the regions doing better than the World LPI decline, it would be important to study why their conservation efforts are working. Specifically, regions of interest would be Europe and Central Asia for the peak in 1991, as well as North America for their increase since 2014.</p>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This visualization was developed in Altair and depicts the 20 animals in the world with the greatest increase in population. This is portrayed using a horizontal bar chart, where each bar represents an animal by their Common Name in the data. The bars are ordered by descending percentage of average relative change in population size, and an Altair color scheme is used to depict the magnitude in change. Moreover, a logarithmic scale and tooltip are implemented to make viewing easier for the reader.</p>

  <h4>Justification</h4>
  <p>By manipulating data from our Living Planet Database (LPD), we are able to show researchers exactly which species are experiencing the most growth, across two different points in time. These species are highlighted so that researchers can study their context, such as their characteristics, conservation work, and more, to understand why they are experiencing the largest increase in population. This could be due to a variety of factors, all of which could be implemented to create better conservation methods for threatened or endangered species and populations.</p>

  <h4>Findings</h4>
  <p>The top three species are the American plaice, silver hake/ whiting, and American eel, which are all part of classes of fish. It seems that it is mostly fish species making the largest increases in animal population, due to conservation efforts as well as their ability to multiply frequently. We also see representation of mammals, with weasels, moose, and chimpanzees. These species are the ones we can look to for hope and research on working conservation efforts.</p>

  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>This visualization was developed in Altair and depicts the 20 animals in the world with the greatest decrease in population. This is portrayed using a horizontal bar chart, where each bar represents an Order of animals in the data. The bar charts are ordered by ascending percent of average relative change in size of populations, and an Altair color scheme is used to depict the magnitude in change. Moreover, a tooltip is implemented to make viewing easier for the reader.</p>

  <h4>Justification</h4>
  <p>This visualization uses data from the Living Planet Database (LPD), but focuses on animal orders with the greatest decrease in population. This enables researchers to narrow down and determine which species require the most intervention and support, and allows them to explore similar patterns that are causing each order to experience a decline. This can help further their knowledge of biodiversity patterns as well as benefit the animals that are in endangerment.</p>

  <h4>Findings</h4>
  <p>The top five orders in this visualization are the Aulopiformes, Procellariformes, Pterocliformes, Rhinopristiformes, and Istiophoriformes, where the three are a type of fish and two are a type of bird. This is interesting because amphibians are the ones experiencing the largest percentage of decreasing populations, then it is fishes and birds. However, this is probably because fish and bird populations just have a higher number of individuals in general. Therefore, it could be more helpful to compare number of animals in a population by species within the same classes, rather than by orders or species.</p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>

  <h3>Biodiversity and conservation</h3>
  <p>Biodiversity is the foundation of healthy ecosystems, providing resources essential for human survival. Our analysis shows the urgent need for conservation efforts, particularly focusing on endangered species to prevent their extinction. The alarming decline in amphibian populations emphasizes the importance of targeted conservation action and policies. While mammals and reptiles show relatively fewer declines, the overall trend in global biodiversity, measured by the Living Planet Index (LPI), is concerning. By identifying species experiencing severe declines and those successfully recovering, we provide valuable insights for conservation strategies. Additionally, recognizing regions with significant biodiversity loss, such as Latin America and the Caribbean, highlights areas where conservation measures should be focused.</p>

  <h3>Current biodiversity trends</h3>
  <p>Our literature review provides important insight for understanding the factors that influence biodiversity decline. Human activities, particularly land use and climate change, are key drivers of biodiversity loss. The Living Planet Database offers insights into global wildlife populations and biodiversity trends that we can use to better understand the effects of current conservation efforts and how to change them for the better. The misinterpretation of the Living Planet Index has led to misconceptions about the severity of biodiversity decline. However, studies such as those by Leung et al. and Louise et al. help clarify the nuances of this decline, identifying specific clusters of extreme population change and proposing methods to mitigate bias in global biodiversity indicators.</p>

  <h3>Importance of visualization</h3>
  <p>Our visualization dashboard can be a useful tool for policymakers and researchers to understand and address biodiversity challenges. By tracking animal populations over time and visualizing their distributions, trends, and changes, our visualizations offer insights for targeted conservation efforts. The interactive maps and charts enable users to explore biodiversity patterns globally and regionally, identifying areas and species of concern. Additionally, visualizations of population and species changes over time highlight key trends. Our visualizations help us understand our current biodiversity and inform future conservation efforts and policies.</p>

  <h3>Limitations and future and research</h3>
  <p>The Living Planet Database, while extensive, does not represent the entire globe equally, with some regions having more data than others. Additionally, our visualizations primarily focus on vertebrate species, potentially overlooking important trends in invertebrate populations. Future research could explore ways to incorporate more comprehensive datasets, including invertebrates and other regions (like the tropics) that are currently less accessible. Additionally, expanding our visualizations to include socioeconomic and policy-related factors could provide a more holistic understanding of biodiversity decline and improve conservation strategies.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Our visualizations and findings are only a start to understanding the state of biodiversity today. There is a need for more data collection in order to more accurately identify animal populations and species in need of intervention, for focused conservation work. Additionally, this would lead to better informed policies that target where attention is needed. Although there is more work to be done, we have hope for the future, as there are many animal populations and species already recovering due to human conservation efforts.</p>
